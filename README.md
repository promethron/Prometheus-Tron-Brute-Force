# Prometheus Tron Brute Force
This script is designed to automatically generate seed phrases and check balances for Tron networks. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, the wallet's information (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) is logged and saved to a file named result.txt.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/promethron/Prometheus-Tron-Brute-Force/main/preview.png)

# Usage
To start the brute force process, run the tronbrut.exe

The script will continuously generate seed phrases and check the balances of the associated wallets. Information about each checked wallet will be logged to the console.
If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, its information will also be appended to result.txt in the project directory.
